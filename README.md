bugs

1. (done) main nav border bottom issue - part of top purple banner disappears when I hover over it
2. (done) submenu - hovering over any part of the list item should underline it
3. (done) Dropdown should be center aligned to its list-item-main-dropdown item
4. main nav overflows the header; body has overflow (media query?)
5. WTA dropdown menu is too narrow, content should fit on one line
6. WTA vertical dropdown is not aligned with the other dropdowm (change top to rem units?)

todo

1. (done) add dropdown animation
2. (done) add arrows to main nav, dropdown menu box
3. add scores across the top that slide across the viewport
